# _Brain Crushers_

_Brain Crushers_ is an experimental project by [Matteo Prosperi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteoprosperi/).

The website is hosted on GitHub pages at [Brain Crushers](https://matteo-prosperi.github.io/BrainCrushers).

I created this website to share C# coding interview questions and other exercises.

Using _Brain Crushers_ you can implement a solution in an environment similar to the ones used during real online coding interviews. _Brain Crushers_ also allows you to test your solution.
