# Escape a char array

**Difficulty:** Easy.

Complete the code of the `Escape` method below to read the first `length` characters of the input array and replace `\` characters with `\` `\` and `"` characters with `\` `"`. Return the new length of the character sequence. You can overwrite any character after `length` and you can assume that the input array is long enough to contain the added characters. For example, when working with the input [ `a`, `"`, `b`, `_`, `_` ] with `length = 3` you should modify the array to [ `a`, `\`, `"`, `b`, `_` ] and return `4`.

For more information, you can review the similar problem [Escape a string](strings-escape).
