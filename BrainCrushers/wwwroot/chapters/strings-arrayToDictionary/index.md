# Convert array to dictionary

**Difficulty:** medium.

The `ToDictionary` method below receives strings in the format `[key]=value`. Complete the method so that it converts the input strings into a dictionary. For example, when reading `"[foo]=bar"`, you would add to the result dictionary `dictionary.Add("foo", "bar")`.

You can use library methods.
