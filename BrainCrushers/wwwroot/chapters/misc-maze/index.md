# Traverse a maze

**Difficulty:** Hard.

Complete the `Traverse` method below to returning the sequence of movements needed to navigate the input maze from the `start` position to the `end` position.

The maze is a square grid of tiles, each tile can either be a wall or a corridor. You can only move up, down, left, or right along corridors. You can never move into a wall tile.

```
█████████████
██        ███
████ ██ █████
█  █S █ █E ██
██ █ ██ ██ ██
██    █     █
█████████████
```

You can use any library methods.

### Tip

You can consider using recursion, but it is not required.

You can consider adding other fields to the `Tile` class, but it is not required either.
