# Calculate array rotation

**Difficulty:** Easy.

The input array `data` is a sorted array that was rotated (see [Rotate an array](arrays-rotate)) by a number of positions. Complete the `GetArrayRotation` method below to return the number of positions the array was rotated. For example `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` corresponds to the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` after being rotated by 2 positions. Always return the smallest positive solution.

Don't use library methods.

**Difficulty:** Medium.

Update the code above to have maximum time complexity *log<sub>2</sub>(n)*. This means completing the find operation without reading more than *2·log<sub>2</sub>(n) + 3* array elements.
