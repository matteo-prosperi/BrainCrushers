# Tower of Hanoi

**Difficulty:** Hard.

The [tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) is a game that is played on a board with three rods (towers). A certain number of disks of decreasing sizes are slid onto the leftmost rod with the largest being at the bottom and the smallest at the top. The goal of the game is to move one disk at a time from any rod to any other rod until all disks are on the rightmost rod. You cannot ever place a larger disk onto a smaller one.

Complete the `Solve` method below returning a solved `Hanoi` problem with `count` disks.

Don't use any library methods.

### Tip

The tower of Hanoi problem can be solved through recursion in roughly 10 lines of code.
