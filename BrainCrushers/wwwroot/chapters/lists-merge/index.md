# Merge sorted lists

**Difficulty:** Easy.

Complete the `Merge` method below which takes two sorted linked lists and merges them into a single sorted list which is returned. This is similar to the [Merge arrays](arrays-merge) exercise.

Don't use any library method.

You can choose whether to break down the two input lists and use their nodes to create the result list or whether to maintain the two input lists untouched and return a new list instead.
