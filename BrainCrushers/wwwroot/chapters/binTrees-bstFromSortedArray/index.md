# Create a binary search trees from a sorted array

**Difficulty:** Medium.

Complete the `ToBinarySearchTree` method below returning a *balanced binary search tree* containing the values from the sorted array passed as parameter. For the sake of this exercise, we define *balanced* as having the minimum possible depth (the deepest branch is at most 1 level deeper than the most shallow one).

You can use library methods.
