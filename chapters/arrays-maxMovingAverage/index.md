# Maximum moving average

**Difficulty:** very easy.

Complete the `MaxMovingAverage3` to return the maximum value of the size 3 [moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of the input array: the average of the three consecutive values with the highest total.

Don't use any library method.

**Difficulty:** Easy.

Complete the `MaxMovingAverage` to find the maximum moving average of size `length`. Return the position of the first element of the found sequence and the average value. Return `-1` if the size of the input array is too short; return the first position in case there are multiple sequences having the maximum average value.

Don't use any library method.

### Did you know?

In C#, You can use [out parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-parameter-modifier) when you need to return more than one value from a method. `out` parameters are particularly common when their value is not always relevant: in this case the `average` value is irrelevant if the method returns `-1`.
